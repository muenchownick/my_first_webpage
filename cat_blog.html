	<h1><u>RYESHIUEK'S PAGE</u></h1>
	<h2><em>Part tiger, part lion</em></h2>
	<h3>BEASTLY</h3>

	<p> Captured and caught in the wilderness of Azoldanoriua. He was found while hibernating next to what was a <em>slaughtered</em> bear, leaving nearby citizens of Aztuluia perplexed by the beast-slaying maneless creature sleeping before them. Ryeshiuek was cared for by Great family of Azendelas until he mysteriously vanished one day. Only to return a fortnight later with not one, but two decapitated local wildabears. The villagers praised the upright feline for days, celebrating feasts in honor of the Slayer of Beasts. Ryeshiuek quickly bored of the festive town; he burnt it down along with everyone inside it.
