	<h2><em>Part angel, part devil</em></h2>
	<h3>Loved forever.</h3>

	<p> When I was 8 my family adopted a rottweiler. The first time it saw me, it made me friends with the ground. She instantly became part of the family. Her name was Dinga. She protected my mother once while on a walk, my mother fainted slightly, and Dinga stood by her side patiently aquiring help. Dinga passed away and our family was struck with a pet-less void. My mother was not quick to move onto another dog, but when we met with Brandi, it was like a second coming. She was a young spirited, lovely Dinga-like rotty. So much character, so much love. She was a member of our family for most of my adolescense. Nothing beats coming home feeling defeated, to only be lifted up past your shoulders by a 4-legged non-verbal communiating angel. Who loved to roll in poop, in and all poop you could find, you little devil.
